- 👋 Hi, I’m @kuno24
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer because i like coding. I like to improve constantly and in programming you never stop learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving Python web development and in the near future Data Science/ML.
- 📫 How to reach me is very simple, please write me an email on kuno.aescht@gmail.com and who know, maybe this will be a first step into a long term agreement.
